The code below launches a web driver and retrieves data from the designated website, Business Recorder. For every article, it extracts the header, the datetime, the content type, the content, and the link. Until the maximum scroll is achieved, the code automatically scrolls down. A pandas data frame contains all of the extracted data. Collected links whose data could not be recovered because of error 403 are shown by the end of the code if you chose to display them.
